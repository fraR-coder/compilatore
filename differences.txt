Final 2023/17/03 Exam Delivery - FRANCESCO RECCHIA - 309559

---List of main changes---
scanner.jflex:
        in token2, for the "num" regexp added the numbers from 20 to 199 that were forgotten
        in the "date" regexp changed the year from 2023 to 2024 
        in token3 i needed to add some parentesis 
parser.cup:
        in header added a final SC after TOK2
        in purchase added a final SC
        in p_list i forgot to consider the "quantity" attribute 

In general some formatting was done and i added a method to roud the price to 2 digits after the dot.

The solution provided during the exam does not work in prticular due to the small errors in the scanner, for the rest all the logic has not been changed.
